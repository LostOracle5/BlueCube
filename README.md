<strong>Features</strong>: The Features tab gives you specific codes that maybe different to some users in order to access your recordings simple scroll down to dictation and dial *93 in order to hear your recording.

<strong>Follow Me</strong>: Follow me tab is designed to call users that have more than one phone by doing so if a user is not at his desk it will simply ring to the next phone on the follow me list so that the user can be reached.

<strong>Call Diversions</strong>: This is a phone feature that enables the user to forward or redirect there incoming calls to a alternate number users can also choose to divert there incoming calls directly to voicemail when call divert is enabled.

Users can also listen to there voice mails by clicking on Portal and than clicking configure and scrolling down to <strong>My Voicemail</strong>.

Most Businesses have a time in which there business opens and closes in order to pick the best time for when you want incoming calls to start and end. Simple access <strong>Time Groups</strong> that is right under <strong>My Voicemail</strong>.
